# Furya Core Integration Tests

This project is meant to increase the success ratio for new core releases, improve reliability and features for [@fury-money/feather.js](https://github.com/fury-money/feather.js). This tests are written using TypeScript with [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and executed in parallel to improve time execution.

### Development

This set of tests must run out of the box in Linux-based systems installing [GoLang 1.20](https://go.dev/), [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), [screen](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/screen-command-in-linux-with-examples/) and [rly](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer).

Keep in mind that tests are executed in paralel when using the same account with two different tests it can misslead test results with errors like "account missmatch sequence" when submitting two transactions with the same nonce, missmatching balances, etc... 

Another good practice with this framework is to isolate and assert values within a test considering that the data is not wiped out each time a new test is executed.
